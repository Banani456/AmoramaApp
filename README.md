# AmoramaApp
Amorama is a react native app created to battle lonliness and depression in the older population. It allows older individuals to be able to exchange quick "BeReal" or "Snap" like images with their loved ones. I created this as a hackathon project in collaboration with two friends. 

















UPDATE: There is some missing code in this repository due to issues with github that will be fixed shortly. Important files are featured here
